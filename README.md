# pingChat
pingChat can be used to demonstrate how to ex filtrate information using the ICMP protocol.  If you can ping between hosts you should be able to use this to send covert messages using ICMP.

Bug: Does not capture and display the packets on a Windows 7 host.  However through Wireshark you can see the packets come across.  Will look at this later.  Windows can send to a linux host...  Linux hosts tested have been Ubuntu...

This was built for educational purposes only.  

If you would like to pingChat with AES encypted messages you can use the branch of withAESEncryption...
